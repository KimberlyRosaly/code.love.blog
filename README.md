application created with '```create-react-app```'.

'```yarn```' is package manager of choice, here.

I intend for this React application to house a more visual portfolio for anyone interested in seeing how I personally combine code with art.
This is a space I could host on my own to showcase, written in React. 
To create a Single Page Application, sort of,  that could easily display 
a gallery of my artwork, 
a page of blog titles that take a user to their views,
there, a place I can post photos, artwork, and projects, write about them in study.


This app will host blogs, art, and links to information.
